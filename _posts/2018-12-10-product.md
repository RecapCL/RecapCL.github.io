# Pros and Cons 

The texture of this cleat is made to specifically to help you have a better first touch. This is a light weight soccer cleat that works to your advantage. You get to "feel like a pro." Just like any other soccer cleat, especially ones with high ankle support such as these, you have to break them in and hope you get used to them fast.
